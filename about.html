            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p> Many years ago when my kids were in daycare (they're 18 & 15 now!) I became friendly with some other tired moms. We decided to start a "book group" in an effort to get out of the house. We chose a book and got together every Tuesday night to discuss the book. Except no one ever read the book because we all had toddlers! But we continued to get together just for the sake of getting out. One of the women in the group knew how to play Mah Jongg and offered to teach us. Slowly but surely, we learned. 
            I'm not competitive by nature but fell in love with the complexity of the game. I started playing with other groups, played online, and took strategy classes. When a friend asked me to teach her to play, I decided to spread my love for Maj out to the world!</p>
